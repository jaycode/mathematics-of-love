This specification provides\nthe framework to bring long overdue localisation methods to ECMAScript implementations.\n\nGoogle have an implementation of this API that is available in recent versions of V8\nand Chrome/Chromium 24 and later. Mozilla also have a working implementation in the\ncurrent Firefox nightly builds.\n\n`Intl.js` fills the void of availability for this API. It will provide the framework as\ndescribed by the specification, so that developers can take advantage of the native API\nin environments that support it, or `Intl.js` for legacy or unsupporting environments.\n\n[Build Status]: https://travis-ci.org/andyearnshaw/Intl.js.png?branch=master\n\n\n## Getting started\nFor Node.js applications, you can install Intl.js using NPM:\n\n    npm install intl\n\nIntl.js is also available as a [Bower](http://bower.io) component for the front-end:\n\n    bower install intl\n\nFor other setups, just clone the repo for the pre-built scripts and locale datafiles.\n\nIn browser environments, the library will try to patch the browser by defining\nthe global `Intl` is not defined.  An example of usage _might_ look like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar nf = new Intl.NumberFormat(undefined, {style:'currency', currency:'GBP'});\ndocument.getElementById('price').textContent = nf.format(100);\n```\n\nIdeally, you will avoid loading this library if the browser supports the\nbuilt-in `Intl`. An example of conditional usage using [yepnopejs][] library\n_might_ look like this:\n\n```javascript\nyepnope({\n  test : window.Intl,\n  nope : ['path/to/intl.js'],\n  complete: function () {\n    var nf = new Intl.NumberFormat(undefined, {style:'currency', currency:'GBP'});\n    document.getElementById('price').textContent = nf.format(100);\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\n[yepnopejs]: http://yepnopejs.com/\n\n## Status\nCurrent progress is as follows:\n\n### Implemented\n - All internal methods except for some that are implementation dependent\n - Checking structural validity of language tags  \n - Canonicalizing the case and order of language subtags\n - __`Intl.NumberFormat`__\n   - The `Intl.NumberFormat` constructor ([11.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-11.1))\n   - Properties of the `Intl.NumberFormat` Constructor ([11.2](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-11.2))\n   - Properties of the `Intl.NumberFormat` Prototype Object ([11.3](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-11.3))\n   - Properties of Intl.NumberFormat Instances([11.4](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-11.4))\n - __`Intl.DateTimeFormat`__ \n   - The `Intl.DateTimeFormat` constructor ([12.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-12.1))\n   - Properties of the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` Constructor ([12.2](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-12.2))\n   - Properties of the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` Prototype Object ([12.3](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-12.3))\n   - Properties of Intl.DateTimeFormat Instances([12.4](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-12.4))\n - Locale Sensitive Functions of the ECMAScript Language Specification\n   - Properties of the `Number` Prototype Object ([13.2](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-13.2))\n   - Properties of the `Date` prototype object ([13.3](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/#sec-13.3))\n\n### Not Implemented\n - `BestFitSupportedLocales` internal function\n - Implementation-dependent numbering system mappings\n - Calendars other than Gregorian\n - Support for time zones\n - Collator objects (`Intl.Collator`) (see below)\n - Properties of the `String` prototype object\n\nA few of the implemented functions may currently be non-conforming and/or incomplete.  \nMost of those functions have comments marked as 'TODO' in the source code.\n\nThe test suite is run with Intl.Collator tests removed, and the Collator\nconstructor removed from most other tests in the suite.  Also some parts of\ntests that cannot be passed by a JavaScript implementation have been disabled,\nas well as a small part of the same tests that fail due to [this bug in v8][].\n\n [this bug in v8]: https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2694\n\n\n## What about Intl.Collator?\n\nProviding an `Intl.Collator` implementation is no longer a goal of this project. There\nare several reasons, including:\n\n - The CLDR convertor does not automatically convert collation data to JSON\n - The Unicode Collation Algorithm is more complicated that originally anticipated,\n   and would increase the code size of Intl.js too much.\n - The Default Unicode Collation Element Table is huge, even after compression, and \n   converting to a native JavaScript object would probably make it slightly larger.\n   Server-side JavaScript environments will (hopefully) soon support Intl.Collator,\n   and we can't really expect client environments to download this data.\n\n\n## Compatibility\nIntl.js is designed to be compatible with ECMAScript 3.1 environments in order to\nfollow the specification as closely as possible. However, some consideration is given\nto legacy (ES3) environments, and the goal of this project is to at least provide a\nworking, albeit non-compliant implementation where ES5 methods are unavailable.\n\nA subset of the tests in the test suite are run in IE 8.  Tests that are not passable\nare skipped, but these tests are mostly about ensuring built-in function behaviour.\n\n\n## Locale Data\n`Intl.js` uses the Unicode CLDR locale data, as recommended by the specification.\nThe data is available in JSON format, or JSONP format in the [locale-data](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/tree/master/locale-data)\nfolder.  This has been converted from CLDR version 24 using the script and config file\nin the [tools](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/tree/master/tools) folder.\n\nThe main `Intl.js` file contains no locale data itself.  In browser environments, the\ndata should be provided, parsed into a JavaScript object, using the\n`Intl.__addLocaleData()` method.  In Node.js, or when using `Intl.complete.js`, the data\nis pre-compiled into the end of the file and does not need to be provided.\n\nContents of the `locale-data` directory are a modified form of the Unicode CLDR\ndata found at http://www.unicode.org/cldr/data/.
